\title{Preload-dependent power laws in detachment dynamics of probalistic fasteners}

When detaching from an elastic fabric substrate, mushroom arrays do not in general
follow a linear force-strain relationship characterized by the ``per mushroom'' modulus $E$.
Rather, the fiber stretching imposes a power law on the force-distance curve, which
we show in Figure \ref{fig:logforce} as a straight line through on a plot of $\log \frac{f}{NA}$
against $\log \lambda$.
